# Project Description
The Global World Analysis project focuses on exploring and analyzing a comprehensive global dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights among countries based on social, economic, environmental, and health-related factors. The project aims to provide a data-driven understanding of how various indicators—such as population density, GDP, CO₂ emissions, agricultural land use, and healthcare expenditure—interact and influence global development trends.

# Key Tasks
1. Country Analysis: Identify represented countries and their data distributions.

2. Population Density: Examine high and low density countries and related trends.

3. Agricultural Land: Study its share and relation to population or emissions.

4. CO₂ Emissions: Measure variations and correlations with GDP and industry.

5. Health Expenditure: Analyze health spending versus GDP and healthcare quality.

6. Labor Force & Unemployment: Understand economic engagement and challenges.

7. Urban Population: Explore urbanization rates and their socio-economic impact.

8. Other Indicators: Include birth rate, armed forces, calling codes, tax revenue, and land area comparisons.
